    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <p id="sum_hb">I like to play games or watch movies in my free time, and I also love to go travel during holidays.</p>

      <h2>Play Games</h2>
      <p><strong>NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</strong></p>
      <img src="images/naraka.png" alt="The picture of NARAKA">
      <p>This is my favorite multiplayer competitive game and it is free. We can control different characters and use different weapons to beat all other players in the game to get first place, and you can see the game in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203220/_/">Steam</a>.</p>
      <p>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01dev0ljlVQ">here</a> to watch the video about the game.</p>
      <p><strong>Elden Ring</strong></p>

      <p>Elden Ring is another game that I like to play. It is a amazing game, for every character has his or her own story. Besides, you can also see the game in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/_/">Steam</a>.</p>

      <h2>Go Travel</h2>
      <p>I have been to many fascinating tourist destinations, including the Great Wall, Mount Tai, Shaolin Temple in Songshan Mountain, and the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang. Each place has unique scenery and culture, which left a deep impression on me. I am a big fun to travel, so I create the travel page and put the introduction of these attractions in my <a href="travel.html">travel</a> page.</p>

      <h2>Watch Movies</h2>
      <p>My favorite movie star is Stephen Chow.</p>
      <img src="images/stephen_chow.png" alt="The picture of Stephen Chow in A Chinese Odyssey">
      <p>He is a renowned Hong Kong filmmaker, celebrated for his comedic genius and iconic performances. I like almost all of his movies like "Kung Fu Hustle" and "A Chinese Odyssey".</p>
      <p>This is one of my favorite episodes:</p>
